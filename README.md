# FreeCast

## Introduction
FreeCast is an interface capable of streaming media over your local network, similar to Google's Cast or Apple's [AirPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289). The latter two are proprietary protocols and integrating them into devices needs permission of the copyright holders as well as a fee. FreeCast is meant to be a free software alternative to the well-known protocols, integrating into devices is highly appreciated and free of charge.

FreeCast is written in `C` and therefore requires minimal hardware prequisities, enabling it to run on smallest IoT devices.
